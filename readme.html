<h1>preface</h1>
<p><em><strong>these are not conventional dotfiles.</strong></em></p>
<p>these days i try to have as much configured through the <a href="https://nixos.org">nix package manager</a> as possible.</p>
<p>if you're not using nix, you won't be able to use them in a simple fashion and would need to isolate the respective aspects.</p>
<hr />
<h2>yet another opinionated minimalistic emacs</h2>
<p>my emacs configuration is based around reducing the user interface down to basic elements without losing the kinds of
functionality you would expect to find in a modern editor such as vscode or sublime.</p>
<p>i've never been much of a fan of modelines because of the space they take up, and feebleline feels like the perfect solution
to this. it migrates the core information displayed on a modeline into the echo area.</p>
